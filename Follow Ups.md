#behaviour 

1. **Lead with a question.** "For Person1 and Person2, where are we on the POCs?" They mostly won't have anything to say. Give them a chance. **Ball in their court.**
2. **Facts.** Follow up with how much time it has been and how their work is blocking others.
3. Rehearse all this quickly in 30 seconds maybe. **Do not repeat yourself on any of the statements.**
4. **Offer help.** _If you want let's catch up today to understand if you are stuck or if there are other priorities._ **Again ball in their court.** 
5. **Soft deadline.** _Let's catch up again on Thursday/Friday maybe._ **Ball in their court.**
