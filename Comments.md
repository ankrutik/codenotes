#coding/bestpractices #checklist 

Try to explain the comment thru code first
- variable names
- extracting to functions

Do not comment because you want to retain bad code
## Good comments
- Legal
- Informative comments 
	- eg. description of regular expressions
- Explain intent
- Clarification of obscure
- Alarms consequences
- TODO
- Amplification on seemingly inconsequential
## Bad comments
- Mumbling
- Redundant 
- Misleading
- Mandated
- Journal
- Noisy comments that lead you to ignore them
- Position markers to explain logic
- Closing brace markers
- Attribution and by lines for contributors
- Commented out code
- HTML
- Non-local information
- Too much information
- In-obvious connections
- Function headers
- Javadocs for non-public code
