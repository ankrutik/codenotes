| Symbol     | What it measures                                 | Units    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| λ (lambda) | How often you get interrupted                    | per hour |
| Δ (delta)  | How long to regain focus after each interruption | minutes  |
| θ (theta)  | Minimum block size for meaningful work           | minutes  |
- System is very sensitive to small inputs
	- That’s a liability when the universe decides to screw you, but it’s also leverage when _you_ intervene. 
- Dropping λ from 3 to 2, just one fewer interruption per hour each day, can transform your week. 
- Learning how to split your tasks into smaller chunks by picking small θ can make your life a whole lot easier. 
- Cutting Δ from 25 to 15 minutes can mean the difference between a hellish day or a passable one. 
- You don’t have to win every battle to win the war.
- Pick one week and defend a single 90-minute block each morning. 
	- Treat that block as your λ/Δ/θ lab. 
	- No meetings, no Slack, no “quick questions.” 
	- Measure what you accomplish in that block versus the rest of your day.
