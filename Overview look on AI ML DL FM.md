LLM
- some context/setting of how the conversation should go
- question
- LLM will predict one word at a time of what the response should be
- Transformer
	- LLM evolution where the question was interpreted all words at the same time instead of one by one
	- Attention
		- all words "talk" to each other to understand context
	- Feed forward neural network
		- extra capacity to store patterns
	- Multiple iterations of Attention and FFNN
	- Weights
		- what the model has learned
	- Data
		- what the model is processing
	- vectors
		- words embedded with direction
		- dot product
			- 0: perpendicular
			- positive: same direction
			- negative: opposite directions
