#coding/bestpractices 

Code formatting is communication. Communication is the professional developer's first order of business.

Vertical formatting
- the newspaper metaphor
	- vertical downwards
- vertical openness between concepts
- vertical density
- vertical distance
	- close related concepts should be closer, same file
	- closely related, same file
- variable declarations as close to each other as possible
- instance variables at the top
- dependent functions close to each other

Horizontal formatting
- openness and density
- alignment is not needed like it used to 
- indentation
