#behaviour #qe #testing 

When QE find large bugs, the testing tends to be restricted around the bugs. 
When no large bugs are being found, QE will tend to test deeper.

This might be because of 
- the wait time brought in due to the bug fix 
- anticipating that large amounts of code might change 
- any testing before that might be redundant
