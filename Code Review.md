#coding/review

- quick scan
	- read JIRA or documents
	- ! should you talk to the dev to understand quicker?
	- commit message
		- correct
		- descriptive
		- conventional format

		- single feature or multiple
	- if concerns here, blocking comment
- is it readable?
	- readable at high level
	- skim the PR and understood what it does?
	- comments where needed?
	- leave a comment if you cannot understand after reading top-to-bottom
- names
	- unclear function and variable names will slow everyone down
	- naming smells
		- placeholder or temporary names left by accident
		- domain mismatch
		- forced to read the implementation to understand the name
- third-party integrations
	- retries
	- timeouts
	- logging
	- error handling
	- idempotency
- is this the best way to do it?
	- Is there...?
		- a simpler way
		- standard library function
		- well-known pattern
		- built-in tool
		- reliable open-source solution
	- Not blocking usually
	- Be respectful of everyone's own way of what perfect code is
